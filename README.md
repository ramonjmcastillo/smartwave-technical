Some things to improve on if I had more time.

1. Add a Skeleton Component to improve user experience when data is still loading
2. Add mobile view to the components and improve styling when mapping through the data
3. Use Sass to remove unneeded class names and to just use css nesting
4. Should've asked questions regarding the API (missing or incorrect data. (Original price is lower than sale price, names are missing))
5. Add Tooltip if Size is not available
